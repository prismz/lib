libgeom
-------
This is a *very* small library.

Requires math.h (link with -lm)

A library with some simple geometry functions.
You can define your own struct for a point on the coordinate plane as "lg_point",
for example:

`
struct my_custom_point {
    double x, y;
    char* other_field;
};

#define lg_point my_custom_point

...
`

libgeom will not set any other fields of the struct besides variables x and y.
libgeom uses doubles.
