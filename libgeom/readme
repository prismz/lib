libgeom
-------
A small library for geometry using doubles.

types:
    struct lg_point {
        double x;
        double y;
    };

functions:
    void lg_midpoint(struct lg_point *p1, struct lg_point *p2, struct lg_point *dest); - midpoint of two points
    double lg_distance(struct lg_point *p1, struct lg_point *p2); - distance between two points
    double lg_pythagorean(double a, double b, double c); - finds pythagorean theorem - pass 0 as unknown value. returns -1 on error.
